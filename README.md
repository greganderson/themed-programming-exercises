# Themed Programming Exercises

These are classic programming problems like reversing a string and optimization loops, but written with a theme. These were generated by ChatGPT (I'm not _that_ creative ðŸ™ƒ). They were written with JavaScript stubbed functions, but the problems are generic and can really be solved with any language.

## Exercises

### Exercise 1: Dragon Slayer
You are a dragon slayer. Write a function that prints numbers from 1 to 100. But for every third dragon, print "Fire" instead of the number and for every fifth dragon, print "Ice". For dragons which are both the third and the fifth, print "Dragon".

### Exercise 2: Magic Mirror
You have a magic mirror that only shows words that are the same forwards and backwards. Write a function that checks whether a given string is a magic word.

```javascript
function isMagicWord(str) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(isMagicWord("racecar")); // true
console.log(isMagicWord("hello"));   // false
```

### Exercise 3: Time Reversal
You have a time reversal spell. Write a function that reverses a given spell (string).

```javascript
function reverseSpell(spell) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(reverseSpell("abracadabra")); // "arbadacarba"
```

### Exercise 4: Treasure Hunt
You are calculating the total number of ways to arrange treasures. Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number of treasures.

```javascript
function treasureArrangements(num) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(treasureArrangements(5)); // 120
```

### Exercise 5: Giantâ€™s Gold
You are searching for the largest piece of gold in a giant's collection. Write a function that returns the largest piece of gold.

```javascript
function findLargestGold(arr) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(findLargestGold([1, 5, 3, 9, 2])); // 9
```

### Exercise 6: Gemstone Sorting
You are sorting a collection of gemstones and need to remove duplicates. Write a function that removes duplicate gemstones.

```javascript
function removeDuplicateGems(arr) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(removeDuplicateGems([1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5])); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Exercise 7: Potion Mixing
You are mixing ingredients for a potion and need to find the total amount. Write a function that returns the sum of all ingredients.

```javascript
function potionMix(ingredients) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(potionMix([1, 2, 3, 4])); // 10
```

### Exercise 8: Enchanted Forest
You are exploring an enchanted forest and need to count the number of magical creatures (vowels) you encounter. Write a function that counts the number of magical creatures in a given string.

```javascript
function countMagicalCreatures(str) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(countMagicalCreatures("hello world")); // 3
```

### Exercise 9: Spellbook Inventory
You are managing a spellbook and need to count the number of spells in it. Write a function that counts the number of spells (properties) in a given spellbook (object).

```javascript
function countSpells(spellbook) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(countSpells({a: 1, b: 2, c: 3})); // 3
```

### Exercise 10: Combine Armies
You are combining two armies and need to ensure no duplicate soldiers. Write a function that merges two arrays of soldiers and removes duplicates.

```javascript
function mergeArmies(army1, army2) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(mergeArmies([1, 2, 3], [3, 4, 5])); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

### Exercise 11: Ice Mage
You are an ice mage converting temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit to ensure your spells are effective. Write a function that converts a given temperature from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

```javascript
function celsiusToIceSpell(celsius) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(celsiusToIceSpell(0)); // 32
console.log(celsiusToIceSpell(25)); // 77
```

### Exercise 12: Sorting Spells
You are a wizard organizing your spells. Write a function that sorts an array of spell power levels in ascending order.

```javascript
function sortSpells(spells) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(sortSpells([5, 3, 8, 1, 2])); // [1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
```

### Exercise 13: Potion Strength
You are calculating the average strength of a potion. Write a function that calculates the average strength of an array of potion strengths.

```javascript
function averagePotionStrength(arr) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(averagePotionStrength([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])); // 3
```

### Exercise 14: Spell Capitalization
You are writing a spellbook and need to capitalize the first letter of each spell. Write a function that capitalizes the first letter of each word in a given string.

```javascript
function capitalizeSpells(spell) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(capitalizeSpells("fireball lightning bolt")); // "Fireball Lightning Bolt"
```

### Exercise 15: Magic Sequence
You are learning a new sequence of spells. Write a function that returns the first `n` numbers in the Magic sequence (Fibonacci sequence).

```javascript
function magicSequence(n) {
  // Your code here
}

console.log(magicSequence(5)); // [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]
```
